	abstract = {Women are one particularly understudied group of entrepreneurs. We know very little about female entrepreneurs, and our ignorance of this important demographic is a serious blind spot in any effort to increase the total number of entrepreneurs participating in our economy. What little we do know suggests that women are not nearly as active in the entrepreneurial space as they could be.

This study attempts to address part of this knowledge gap. This based on data were collected in 2008-2009 from 549 respondents from randomly selected high-tech companies who were invited to participate. It compares the backgrounds, and experiences and motivations of men and women entrepreneurs.

Our findings show that successful women and men entrepreneurs are similar in almost every respect. They had equivalent levels of education (slightly less than half earned graduate degrees), early interest in starting their own business (about half had at least some interest), a strong desire to build wealth or capitalize on a business idea, access to funding, and they largely agreed on the top issues and challenges facing any entrepreneur.

The data also identify some small but potentially informative gender differences among successful entrepreneurs. For instance, motivations for starting a business differed slightly between men and women. The latter were more likely to cite a business partner’s encouragement as a key incentive to take the plunge. Women also were more likely than men to get early funding from their business partners.},

	abstract = {In most {VC-backed} firms neither the entrepreneurs nor the {VC} investors control the board. Instead control is typically shared with a mutually appointed independent director holding the tie-breaking seat. Contract theory, which treats control as an indivisible right held by one party, does not have a good explanation for this practice. Using a bargaining game similar to final offer arbitration, I show that an independent director as tie-breaker can reduce holdup by moderating each party’s ex post threat position, potentially expanding the range of firms which receive external financing. This project contributes to the literature on incomplete contracting and holdup, and improves our understanding of governance arrangements in startup firms.},

Instead, angels reduce expected agency costs by forcing entrepreneurs to hold a larger stake in the firm, thereby aligning the interests of the entrepreneur with the outcome of the firm. In addition, angels use more informal methods such as investing in close geographic proximity and syndicating investments with other angels to mitigate risks.},

Using a hand-collected dataset of Silicon Valley firms, we investigate how {VCs} overcome such resistance. We find, in our sample, that {VCs} give bribes (carrots) to the entrepreneurial team in 45\% of trade sales; in these sales, carrots total an average of 9\% of deal value. The overt use of coercive tools (sticks) occurs, but only rarely.

Using a hand-collected dataset of Silicon Valley startup firms, we find little evidence that {VCs} use inside rounds to dilute founders.

	url = {http://ssrn.com/abstract=2002212},
	abstract = {This white paper outlines some of the remaining state barriers and a few federal ones and how they prevent disruptive innovations by entrepreneurs and established firms alike that potentially could bring new and more efficient business models to the market. In the case of the legal sector, the barriers we identify not only adversely affect legal innovation, but also impede innovation in other sectors of the economy. Similarly, in health care, pharmaceuticals, K-12 education, the financing of growth businesses, and many consumer services, legal obstructions hinder innovation and the provision of efficient, affordable, high-quality services and products.

We conclude by surveying the main options for reducing or eliminating these impediments, proposing, in effect, ways to provide a “license to grow.” Although most of the ideas we list are relevant only to state and local governments, we do not recommend, however tempting it may be, federal preemption as the means to their abolition. Apart from the political difficulty of gaining consensus on a sensible preemption approach in a time of deep partisanship with the Congress, it is not necessary for citizens to look to Washington to solve all problems.

This white paper is an extension of the Startup Act in which the Kauffman Foundation outlined ways the federal government can stimulate new company formation and growth, encouraging economic growth across the economy. In a companion to this report, the Foundation also will publish a separate template for state and local {“Startup} Acts” - in reality, both executive and legislative measures - that would reinforce and amplify the impact of startup-friendly policies at the federal level. This particular white paper focuses primarily on removing state and local impediments to entrepreneurial growth and thus, we hope, will make an important contribution to the public policy debate in its own right.

Many of the ideas outlined here also will be included in a summary fashion in the companion Kauffman report on a broader startup agenda for state and local governments. As prior Kauffman research has made clear, new firm formation and growth are critical to job creation and economic growth in general. The persistently high rates of unemployment since the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the decline in formation rate of new employer firms in recent years make a startup agenda at all levels of government more urgent than ever.

Serial entrepreneurial experience is at best seen as one of the inputs into firm performance. In this paper we argue for an instrumental view of the firm by formally showing that entrepreneurs can amplify their expected success rates (as compared to firm success rates) by exploiting contagion processes embedded in serial entrepreneurship. The advantages to holding concurrent portfolios that exploit heterogeneity are well known. The same advantages may be achieved in the serial context through contagion. Our model exploits an observation due to William Feller on the near equivalence of the two, statistically speaking. It also leads to empirically sound implications about the size distribution of firms in the economy and suggests more nuanced approaches toward future research.

	abstract = {In the last few decades, we have developed a substantial body of knowledge about {CEO} succession. However, except for some studies of family businesses that lack direct applicability to nonfamily {CEO} succession, the past studies of succession have not examined the very first succession event in a firm, when the Founder-{CEO} is replaced, on a large-scale basis. The critical differences between later-stage succession and Founder-{CEO} succession include the higher level of attachment between Founder-{CEOs} and the firms they create, the much larger equity holdings of Founder-{CEOs} (which give them much more control of the firm), the fact that many Founder-{CEOs} remain in the firm (even though it is being run by their successors), and the fact that nearly all early-stage succession events involve outside successors (in contrast to later-stage succession research, which has focused on the insider-outsider distinction). These differences make it hard to extrapolate from later-stage succession findings to Founder-{CEO} succession. Therefore, in order to examine Founder-{CEO} succession, I used field research and grounded theory building to study the factors that should affect Founder-{CEO} succession in Internet start-ups. I find that there are two central intertemporal events that may affect Founder-{CEO} succession: The completion of product development and the raising of each round of financing from outside investors. I develop testable hypotheses about how each of these events affect the rate of succession, and then test these hypotheses using an event-history analysis of a unique dataset containing the succession histories of 202 Internet firms. My findings point to multiple “paradoxes of success” in which the Founder-{CEO's} success at achieving critical milestones actually causes the chance of Founder-{CEO} succession to rise dramatically.},

	abstract = {This project presents six years of hand-collected federal district court data to analyze the first representative sample of veil piercing litigation. Our method identifies veil piercing complaints through Westlaw's trial pleadings database and codes each case through a detailed examination of {PACER} records. We test a variety of hypotheses to understand how such litigations are resolved.

We find that plaintiffs succeed quite often in veil piercing litigation, if success is defined as winning on motions that do not terminate a case. A variety of legal and extra-legal factors predict such interstitial veil piercing successes. Voluntary creditor causes of action promote veil piercing; {LLCs} are in very limited circumstances better insulated from veil piercing claims than corporations; undercapitalization is strongly associated with success while conclusory grounds like "façade" and "sham" are not; and defendants' legal sophistication is predictive of plaintiff failure. Extra-legal factors play a more striking and counterintuitive role. Plaintiffs suing companies with few employees are much more likely to win veil piercing motions, and obtain relief in cases, than plaintiffs suing companies employing many workers. This results holds even when controlling for legally-relevant variables. Contrary to both theory and previous empirical work, we also find that judicial liberalism is inversely related to the likelihood of plaintiff success.

Our results call into question existing normative and descriptive approaches to the disputation of limited liability and contribute to more general scholarship about selection effects and judicial behavior. They do not provide any easy answers to the question of what defendants can do to insulate themselves from veil piercing. Our analysis suggests: Very little, apart from being very big.},

	title = {Why Courts Pierce: An Empirical Study of Piercing the Corporate Veil},
	volume = {7},
	url = {http://ssrn.com/abstract=1870375},
	abstract = {Limited liability of business owners for the contracts, torts and other liabilities of their companies has been commonplace for over one hundred and fifty years. This concept of limited liability means that a business owner's potential personal loss is a fixed amount, namely, the amount invested in the business, usually in the form of stock ownership. Consequently, if the business succeeds, the owner obtains the profits, but if the business fails, all of the losses beyond the owner's fixed investment are absorbed by others, that is, voluntary or involuntary creditors, or society at large. Although initially applicable primarily to corporations, new forms of business organizations have appeared, such as limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies, which also offer limited liability to their owners.

Although limited liability for business owners is common, it is not uncontroverted. From the very beginning, relieving business owners of liability for the operations of the business has had proponents and detractors. In the 1800s, Thomas Cooper described corporate limited liability as a "mode of swindling, quite common and honourable in these United States" and "a fraud on the honest and confiding part of the public." In rhetorical counterpoint, President Nicholas Butler of Columbia University proclaimed limited liability as "the greatest single discovery of modern times," and that "even steam and electricity are far less important than the limited liability corporation, and they would be reduced to comparative impotence without it." The academic debate over the propriety of limited liability continues unabated.

This ambivalence over the propriety of limited business liability is reflected in the courts in the form of veil piercing. Piercing the corporate veil is a common law legal doctrine used to break rules of traditional limited liability for owners, and to hold shareholders accountable as though the corporation's action was the shareholders' own. In deciding whether to pierce the veil, courts look to sometimes disparate factors and often use unhelpful, conclusory characterizations such as "alter ego" and "instrumentality" to describe the relationship between the shareholders and the corporation. While "piercing the corporate veil is the most litigated issue in corporate law," common law piercing is complex, inconsistently applied and often poorly understood.

The empirical project presented by this Article is unique. This study is the first to empirically examine the distinct question of substantive common law piercing of the corporate veil. As a matter of pure hypothesis, one would expect that any common law doctrine should be applied by the courts in a neutral manner, that is, evenhandedly except for variations in factors explicitly and specifically identified as part of the applicable test. Given that presumption, the empirical results of this study, even on a descriptive level, are startling. Among the statistically significant findings are:

Courts pierce twice as often to hold individual persons liable than they do to hold entities, such as corporations and limited liability companies (parent-subsidiary piercing), liable.

Entity plaintiffs are almost twice as likely as individual plaintiffs to successfully pierce the corporate veil.

Courts are more likely to pierce to enforce a contract claim than to award recovery to a tort claimant

The "kitchen-sink' approach to piercing litigation (adding as many possible substantive claims as possible) is not as effective as bringing a single claim.

More fundamentally, this Article is the first to apply to substantive piercing the advanced statistical techniques of quantitative {analysis.This} study has produced a number of key findings brought to light only through the implementation of logistic regression methodology. Among these findings are:

Pure descriptive statistics indicate that the relationship between plaintiff type (i.e. individual or entity) and claim type (tort, contract, etc.) is statistically significant, as are the relationships separately between plaintiff type and piercing and between claim type and piercing. This would suggest that either claim type or plaintiff type, or both, would have a statistically significant effect on piercing. However, this does not prove to be true when these hypotheses are tested in the regression models. That is, even though these descriptive statistics tell us when courts pierce, they do not explain why courts pierce.

Fraud, owner control, and commingling of funds have the strongest and most predictive relationship with piercing the corporate veil. Indeed, the presence or absence of these factors alone is usually dispositive of the piercing decision.

Conversely, factors reflecting the lack of operational formalities, such as non-existence or non-functioning of corporate directors or officers, are not significantly related to piercing in the regression models.

While only discussed in 3\% of cases, assumption of the risk has a large impact on incidence of piercing the corporate veil. It is the only factor that applies to plaintiffs, and when a court finds it present the likelihood of a pierce is drastically reduced.},

	abstract = {Economic theory suggests that wealthy entrepreneurs demand limited liability to shield their personal assets. Yet, despite an extensive theoretical literature, there are no empirical studies which directly test this claim. Using restricted-access data from the Kauffman Firm Survey, I find a positive correlation between entrepreneur wealth and formation of a limited liability entity; but the economic magnitude of this effect is small and for many entrepreneurs the result cannot be attributed to exogenous variation in personal asset exposure. I use bankruptcy exemptions to identify exogenous variation in each entrepreneur’s asset exposure. My results are consistent with two interpretations, both of which challenge existing scholarship: (i) limited liability, while relevant, is a secondary consideration when choosing organizational form, at least for small owner-operated businesses, or (ii) entrepreneurs are largely unaware of personal bankruptcy exemptions.},

The incorporated self-employed have a distinct combination of cognitive, noncognitive, and family traits.

The combination of “smarts” and “aggressive/illicit/risk-taking” tendencies as a youth accounts for both entry into entrepreneurship and the comparative earnings of entrepreneurs. In contrast to a large literature, we also find that entrepreneurs earn much more per hour than their salaried counterparts.},

	abstract = {Entrepreneurs are among the most celebrated people in our culture. Celebrity entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, often grace the covers of prominent publications. These company founders and innovators fuel economic growth and give the nation its competitive edge.

However, very little is known today about the backgrounds, life histories, motivations and beliefs of these entrepreneurs. So myths and stereotypes prevail. The commonly held belief is that entrepreneurs are young, lightly-educated, childless unmarried workaholics. They are perceived to come from rich families and graduate from elite colleges.

But is this true?

This research answers some of these questions. This is based on a survey of 549 company founders in 12 high-growth industries.

It finds that most founders came from middle-class or upper-lower-class backgrounds, are well-educated and married with children. The strongest motivation for starting a company was to "build wealth". Other popular motivators included capitalizing on a business idea; the appeal of a startup culture; a desire to own a company; and a lack of interest in working for someone else.},
