Bibliography
============

A collection of things I've read over the past year and a half during my semi-sabbatical.

The primary areas of focus are:

* Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital
* Computer Science and Software Engineering
* Data, Databases, and Data Science

Additionally, there several books and papers about design, journalism, publishing, content strategy, and copyright.

Note that this list is still very incomplete, and I also intend to add readable versions in markdown.

Many of the items here are listed on my Readmill profile with shared highlights: https://readmill.com/hi
