Bibliography
============

A collection of books and papers I've read over the past year during my semi-sabbatical.

The primary areas of focus are:

* Entrepreneurship, Business Law, and Venture Capital
* Computer Science and Software Engineering
* Data, Databases, and Data Science

Additionally, there several books and papers about design, journalism, publishing, content strategy, and copyright.

Many of the items here are listed on my Readmill profile with shared highlights: https://readmill.com/hi

Not yet included are a selection of items related to stock options and
